# Issue Due (Automated Notification)

Source: https://rmxhelp.rentmanager.com/Topics/Express/Other/Automated-Notifications/Issue-Due.htm

The Issue Due automated notification can be configured to send an email or text message to users or external recipients as the due date of an open service issue approaches. This can be used to remind technicians that one of their issues must be completed in a timely manner or inform managers about upcoming issues that may need attention.

 This automated notification is Schedule based, meaning that notifications are sent overnight (or at the scheduled time) on the day that the notification's conditions are met.

 Set Up a Notification

 You can create multiple configurations so that recipients for different properties can receive alerts. For example, you may wish to notify only users with the Maintenance role when a service issue is due at certain properties, but notify the users who work on issues at all properties when an issue they are assigned to is due in the near future. Each configuration displays in the Notification Setups list on the left of the page.
