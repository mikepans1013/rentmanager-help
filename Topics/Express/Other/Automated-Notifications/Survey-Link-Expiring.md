# Survey Link Expiring (Automated Notification)

Source: https://rmxhelp.rentmanager.com/Topics/Express/Other/Automated-Notifications/Survey-Link-Expiring.htm

The Survey Link Expiring automated notification can be configured to alert tenants prior to the expiration of a survey link they were sent, allowing tenants to respond to a survey before they miss the opportunity to participate.

 This automated notification is Schedule based, meaning that notifications are sent overnight (or at the scheduled time) on the day that the notification's conditions are met.

 Set Up a Notification

 You can create multiple configurations so that recipients for different properties can receive alerts with varying time frames and messages. For example, you may wish to send reminders to tenants at all of your properties 3 days ahead of a survey link expiring so that they have ample opportunity to respond, but with a different message for specific properties. Each configuration displays in the Notification Setups list on the left of the page.

 More Information

 The option to send the notification as a text is available only if you have the Texting feature, which is a licensed feature and must be purchased separately. For more information, contact your sales representative at sales@rentmanager.com .
