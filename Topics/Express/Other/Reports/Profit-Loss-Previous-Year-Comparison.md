# Profit & Loss Previous Year Comparison (Report)

Source: https://rmxhelp.rentmanager.com/Topics/Express/Other/Reports/Profit-Loss-Previous-Year-Comparison.htm

The Profit & Loss Previous Year Comparison report displays income and expense general ledger (GL) accounts for selected properties across two date ranges: one that the user selects and one that covers the same date range in the previous year. This P&L report's dual date ranges allow you to see the percentage and dollar amount change in profitability from one year to the next. To get the most meaningful results, it is highly recommended that your date ranges do not exceed a twelve-month period.

 More Information

 The GL start date is considered the financial start date, so any transactions or information dated before the GL start date are not included in the report results.
